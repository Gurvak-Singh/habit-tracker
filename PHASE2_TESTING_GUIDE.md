## üìä Expected Results & Success Criteria

### ‚úÖ Success Indicators:
- [ ] All habit modal tabs (Basic Info, Goals, Reminders) are functional
- [ ] Goals are created, edited, and deleted successfully
- [ ] Milestones are automatically initialized for new habits

2. **Goals Not Saving:**
   - Check browser localStorage quota
   - Verify no JavaScript errors in console
   - Clear localStorage if corrupted: `localStorage.clear()`

3. **Celebrations Not Showing:**
   - Ensure habit completion triggers milestone checks
   - Check console for achievement unlock logs
   - Verify celebration component is rendered in DOM

4. **Performance Issues:**
   - Clear browser cache
   - Check for memory leaks in dev tools
   - Reduce number of test habits if needed
