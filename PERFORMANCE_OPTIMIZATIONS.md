- ✅ Reduced layout thrashing with `will-change`
- ✅ Smooth scrolling behavior
- ✅ Prevented overscroll behavior

### Expected Impact:
- **Animation performance:** 60 FPS consistent
- **Scroll performance:** Smoother
- **Paint operations:** 20-30% faster

---

## 7. **Preloader System**
**File:** `components/preloader.tsx`

### Changes Made:
- ✅ Font preloading system
- ✅ Resource preloading with graceful fallbacks
- ✅ Smooth transition to main app
- ✅ Branded loading screen

### Expected Impact:
- **Initial render:** Smoother
- **Font flash:** Eliminated
- **Professional appearance:** Enhanced

---

## 8. **Data Structure Optimizations**
**Files:** `hooks/use-habits.ts`

### Changes Made:
- ✅ Optimized habit statistics calculation
- ✅ Reduced unnecessary data processing
- ✅ Better memory usage patterns
- ✅ Cached computation results

### Expected Impact:
- **Memory usage:** 15-25% reduction
- **CPU usage:** 20-30% lower
- **Battery life:** Better (mobile)

## 🎯 Testing the Optimizations

### Before Testing:
1. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
2. **Disable cache in DevTools** (Network tab)
3. **Use incognito mode** for clean testing

### Performance Testing Steps:

#### 1. **Initial Load Test:**
```bash
# Start the app
npm run dev

# Navigate to http://localhost:3000
# Measure time from URL entry to full page render
```

#### 2. **Dashboard Navigation Test:**
```bash
# From home page, click "Try Dashboard"
# Measure navigation time
```

#### 3. **Habit Operations Test:**
```bash
# Create new habit
# Toggle habit completion
# Edit existing habit
# Measure response times
```

#### 4. **Browser Performance Tools:**
- **Chrome DevTools > Performance tab**
- **Lighthouse audit**
- **Network throttling simulation**

### Expected Results:
- ✅ Lighthouse Score: 90+ Performance
- ✅ First Contentful Paint: <1.5s
- ✅ Largest Contentful Paint: <2.5s
- ✅ Time to Interactive: <3s

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If Performance Issues Persist:

1. **Clear All Caches:**
   ```bash
   # Clear Next.js cache
   rm -rf .next
   
   # Reinstall dependencies
   npm ci
   
   # Restart dev server
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Check for Memory Leaks:**
   - Open Chrome DevTools > Memory tab
   - Take heap snapshots during navigation
   - Look for growing memory usage

3. **Profile Components:**
   - Use React DevTools Profiler
   - Identify slow-rendering components
   - Check for unnecessary re-renders

4. **Network Optimization:**
   - Check bundle analyzer
   - Verify lazy loading is working
   - Monitor network requests
